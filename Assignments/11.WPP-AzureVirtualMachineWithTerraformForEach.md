### Assignment: Create Azure VMs with NICs using Terraform

**Objective:** 

Write a Terraform configuration to deploy multiple Azure Virtual Machines, each with its own Network Interface Card (NIC). Utilize the `foreach` and `for` constructs to dynamically create the VMs and NICs based on a list of configurations.

**Requirements:**

1. Define a variable for VM configurations including name, size, and NIC name.
2. Use the `foreach` construct to create a Network Interface Card for each VM.
3. Use the `foreach` construct to create a Virtual Machine for each configuration, linking it to the corresponding NIC.
4. Ensure each VM and NIC has a unique identifier based on the list of configurations.

**Deliverables:**

- A Terraform configuration file (`main.tf`) implementing the above logic.
- Proper resource dependencies and configurations to ensure successful deployment.

**Instructions:**

1. Define the necessary provider and variable configurations.
2. Use `foreach` to create NICs and VMs.
3. Ensure that each VM is associated with its respective NIC.

**Note:** Make sure to configure Azure credentials and adjust any other necessary settings for your environment.
