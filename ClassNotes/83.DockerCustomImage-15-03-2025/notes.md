# 🚀 **Docker Image Creation & Mindset — Batch 16-2**

---

### 📌 **Docker Image Creation Flow**

✅ **Dockerfile**

* Defines steps to create a Docker image.
* Example for nginx base:

  ```
  FROM nginx
  COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html
  ```
* Build the image:

  ```
  docker buildx build . -t IMAGE:v1
  ```
* Example tag:

  ```
  docker buildx build . -t rinkiakepapa:v1
  ```

### 📌 **Temporary Container (Old Method)**

* Create container → Modify manually → Commit as image
* Less efficient than Dockerfile + `docker build`

---

### 📌 **React App Dockerfile Challenge**

✅ **3️⃣ Daily diary**

* Write topics, plan study → Avoid self-cheating

✅ **4️⃣ Cross your threshold**

* Push beyond comfort zone to grow 🚀

👉 **VERY IMPORTANT**
These practices are critical to succeed!

## Summary

👉 Use Dockerfile + `docker build` (or `docker buildx build`) for clean, repeatable image builds
👉 Build resilience through practice, planning, and reflection
