### Git on Server

**Git Overview:**
- Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously.
- It tracks changes in source code and enables collaboration.

**Server-Side Git Repositories:**
- Git can be hosted on various platforms, allowing teams to share code and collaborate effectively.
- A server-side repository can be either a bare repository or a non-bare repository, but typically, servers use bare repositories to prevent direct modifications.

### GitHub

**Overview:**
- GitHub is a popular platform for hosting Git repositories.
- It provides additional features such as pull requests, issues tracking, project management tools, and a web-based interface for collaboration.

**Key Features:**
- **Forking:** Users can create personal copies of repositories to experiment or contribute.
- **Pull Requests:** Facilitates code review and merging of changes from different contributors.
- **Issues:** Track bugs, feature requests, and tasks.
- **Actions:** Automate workflows for CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment).

**Usage:**
- To create a new repository, sign in to GitHub, click on "New Repository," and follow the prompts.
- Clone a repository using `git clone <repository-url>`.
- Push changes with `git push origin <branch-name>`.

### Azure Repos

**Overview:**
- Azure Repos is part of Azure DevOps, providing Git repositories for source control.
- It supports both Git and TFVC (Team Foundation Version Control).

**Key Features:**
- **Branch Policies:** Enforce best practices and set requirements for code changes.
- **Pull Requests:** Similar to GitHub, allows for collaborative code review.
- **Integration:** Works seamlessly with Azure DevOps services like Boards and Pipelines.

**Usage:**
- Create a new repository from the Azure DevOps portal.
- Clone using `git clone <repository-url>`.
- Push changes similarly to GitHub with `git push origin <branch-name>`.

### Bare Repository

**Definition:**
- A bare repository is a repository that does not have a working directory. It only contains the version control data (the `.git` directory).
- Typically used as a central repository on a server where developers push and pull changes.

**Characteristics:**
- Lacks checked-out files (the actual source code); it only contains the Git metadata and object database.
- Prevents direct editing of the source code, ensuring that changes are made through Git commands.
- Allows multiple users to collaborate without conflicts from direct file edits.

**Creating a Bare Repository:**
- To create a bare repository, use the command:
  ```bash
  git init --bare <repo-name>.git
  ```
- This initializes a repository that can be used as a remote for pushing and pulling code.

### Summary

Using Git on a server allows for efficient collaboration through platforms like GitHub and Azure Repos. Understanding the structure of bare repositories is crucial for maintaining a clean workflow and preventing conflicts in a collaborative environment. Both platforms offer powerful tools to enhance development processes, including version control, code review, and CI/CD integrations.
