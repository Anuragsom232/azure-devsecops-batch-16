# ðŸ“„ What is a YAML Pipeline in Azure DevOps?

A **YAML pipeline** is a way to define your CI/CD process using code (in `.yaml` format) in your repository.

### ðŸ§± Basic Structure of a YAML Pipeline

```yaml
trigger:
  - main  # Runs pipeline when code is pushed to 'main' branch

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'  # Agent machine to run pipeline

steps:
  - task: UseDotNet@2
    inputs:
      packageType: 'sdk'
      version: '7.x.x'
    displayName: 'Install .NET SDK'

  - script: dotnet build
    displayName: 'Build the project'

  - script: dotnet test
    displayName: 'Run tests'
```
